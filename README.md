messyfront
==========

MESSyFront is a frontend for the MESS emulator. The main goal of the project is to get the user into the emulation environment as quickly as possible. The secondary goal is targeting Tandy Color Computer users that run Linux (or *nix environments).  This project is no longer active and very out of date.
